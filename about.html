                <p>I have a big amount of hobbies which I will only list a few that I believe are relevant to all day uses to me.</p>
                <p>One of the hobbies I have, is what you would expect from this page and all the information. This is coding. I enjoy learning different coding languages and enjoy making things with the code. This portfolio has been very fun to make.</p>
